FIRST READING.     Zechariah 9:9_10
"Behold, your king comed to you, humble."
A reading from the Book of the Prophet Zechariah

Thus says the Lord: Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king comes to you; triumphant and victorious is he, humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt the foal of a donkey.  I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the war horse from Jerusalem; and the battle bow shall be cut off, and he shall command peace to the nations; his dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth. 
The word of the Lord. 

RESPONSORIAL PSALM.     Psalm 145
R. I will bless your name forever, my king and my God. 

I will extol you, my God and King, 
and bless your name forever and ever.
I will bless you day after day,
and praise your name forever and ever.  R.

The Lord is kind and full of compassion, 
slow to anger, abounding in mercy. 
How good is the Lord to all, 
Compassionate to all his creatures. R.

All your works shall thank you, O Lord, 
and all your faithful ones bless you. 
They shall speak of the glory of your reign,
and declare your mighty deeds. R.

The Lord is faithful in all His words,
and holy in all his deeds.
The Lord supports all who falls,
and raises up all who are bowed down. R.
